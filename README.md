Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our project repository, where weâ€™ve documented everything about our project journey. From initial brainstorming to the final report,

Here's what you will find in the repository:

1)B365-Project_Draft: This was our first attempt at organizing our ideas. It includes the initial goals, approaches, and a rough timeline for the project. Think of it as the brainstorming phase captured in written form.

2)B365_Project_Proposal: A more polished and detailed proposal where we refined our objectives, clearly defined the problem, and outlined how we planned to approach the project. At this stage, we finalized our datasets and determined the methods weâ€™d use to analyze them. This served as our roadmap for the entire project.

3)B365_FinalReport: The final report includes a detailed breakdown of the methods we used, the findings we discovered, and our overall conclusions. Weâ€™ve also highlighted the challenges we faced, the insights we gained along the way, and ideas for possible future improvements.

4)Data Files: These two CSV files were crucial for our project. They contain the data we analyzed and used as input for our models and visualizations.

5)notebook.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code we wrote to implement different models. It also includes visualizations, graphs, and the results we achieved with each method. If youâ€™re curious about how we processed the data and reached our conclusions, this is the place to look.

6)Video.mov: A recording of our presentation, where we explain our project in detail. In the video, we walk through the code, discuss our findings, and highlight the key results of our work.

7)B365_presentation: These are the slides from our final presentation. They provide a concise and visual summary of the entire projectâ€”perfect for a quick overview without diving into all the details.
